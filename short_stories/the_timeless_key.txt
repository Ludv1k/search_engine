In a dusty attic, Lina found a peculiar brass key etched with strange symbols. 
Intrigued, she pocketed it and searched for a lock it could open. Days later, she stumbled upon an ancient oak chest buried under ivy in the woods. 
The key fit perfectly.

As the lid creaked open, a gust of shimmering light enveloped her. 
When it faded, Lina found herself in a vibrant world of towering crystal trees and floating islands. 
A voice whispered, "The key chooses its keeper. Your adventure begins."

From that day forward, Lina became a wanderer across realms, the key guiding her to mysteries only she could uncover.
