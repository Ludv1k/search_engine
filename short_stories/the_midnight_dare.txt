On a moonless night, three friends stood outside the gates of the abandoned Blackthorn Manor, daring each other to step inside. 
Legend said anyone who entered would never be seen again.

Sarah, the bravest of the group, pushed the heavy doors open, revealing a grand hall frozen in time. 
Chandeliers flickered to life, and faint music played from nowhere.

"See? Just an old house," she whispered, until she noticed her friends had vanished.
 A figure appeared at the top of the staircaseâ€”a shadowy woman with hollow eyes.

Sarah turned to run, but the door had disappeared. 
The house had claimed another visitor, as it always did on a midnight dare.
