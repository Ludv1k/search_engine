Leo tinkered with his old ham radio in the quiet of his workshop. 
Static buzzed through the speakers until, suddenly, a faint voice emerged.

"Is anyone out there? 
This is Astronaut Mark Greer, stranded on mission Jupiter-12. 
I've been lost for 47 years."

Leo froze. 
The Jupiter-12 mission was a failed expedition declared lost decades ago. 
Yet, the voice sounded clear and desperate. 
Determined, Leo sent a reply, setting off a chain of events that would unite the world in an interstellar rescue effort.

The first words Mark heard back made his eyes well with tears: "You're not forgotten. We're coming."
